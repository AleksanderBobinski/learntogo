Learn to go

The idea is to write a client-server app that will allow two clients to connect
via the server and exchange text messages.

Self-imposed limitations:
* At least one client written in go
* The server written in go
* gRPC used for communication
* One connection is encrypted via TLS
* Code coverage >= 95%

Expected outcomes:
* Better understanding of gRPC
* Better understanding of go
* Better understanding of go unit tests
* Some understanding of TLS
